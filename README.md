CoderStack API
======================
Welcome to the readme for [CoderStack](http://www.coderstack.co.uk) API.

The API hasn't been released yet, but this should give you a view of the direction we're going in.

Features the API will have:

* Full job descriptions
* Location data
* Tag data

What it won't have:

* How to apply data (sorry, this would make it too easy for spammers to harvest email addresses!)

The initial release is likey to be limited to querying using the following categories (matching the relevant categories on site):

* [ASP Jobs](http://www.coderstack.co.uk/asp-jobs)
* [C# Jobs](http://www.coderstack.co.uk/c%23-jobs)
* [C Jobs](http://www.coderstack.co.uk/c-jobs)
* [C++ Jobs](http://www.coderstack.co.uk/c++-jobs)
* [Erlang Jobs](http://www.coderstack.co.uk/erlang-jobs)
* [Flash Jobs](http://www.coderstack.co.uk/flash-jobs)
* [Javascript Jobs](http://www.coderstack.co.uk/javascript-jobs)
* [Java Jobs](http://www.coderstack.co.uk/java-jobs)
* [Objective-C Jobs](http://www.coderstack.co.uk/objectivec-jobs)
* [Perl Jobs](http://www.coderstack.co.uk/perl-jobs)
* [PHP Jobs](http://www.coderstack.co.uk/php-jobs)
* [Python Jobs](http://www.coderstack.co.uk/python-jobs)
* [Ruby Jobs](http://www.coderstack.co.uk/ruby-jobs)

We will however offer a firehose service if you want to do more complex querying.
